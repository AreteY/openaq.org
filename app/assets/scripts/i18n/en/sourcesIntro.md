Listed below are the latest data sources and associated datasets accessible on the OpenAQ platform. With your help, we expect this list will grow in the next few months, so check back often. In this first iteration of the platform: (1) We are only collecting data from official, stationary government monitors and not smaller-scale or mobile monitoring. (2) We are collecting PM2.5, PM10, ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and black carbon (BC).  Note: We cannot verify the accuracy of the data.
