We are a community of scientists, software developers, and lovers of open environmental data, building the worldâ€™s first open platform that provides programmatic real-time and historical access to air quality data from around the globe.

[Learn how to access data](https://medium.com/@openaq/accessing-a-playground-of-air-quality-data-124ebd27ec8a#.n3aezb3qd) aggregated onto our platform!

And [check out] (https://medium.com/@openaq/tools-built-by-the-openaq-community-857a82ad9ca9#.w48xyuycd) what tools and sofrware packages our community is building to browse, visualize and use the data.

Shoot us an email at [info@openaq.org](mailto:info@openaq.org) or follow us at [@Open_AQ](https://twitter.com/open_aq) to find out more, give us feedback or  tell us about any awesome open air quality work you're up to!

This platform is possible because of air quality agencies around the world, which do the hard task of generating and publicly sharing these data.
