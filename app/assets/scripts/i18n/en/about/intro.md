We are a community of scientists, software developers, and lovers of open environmental data, building the worldâ€™s first open platform that provides programmatic real-time and historical access to air quality data from around the globe.

Find out how to [access the data](https://medium.com/@openaq/accessing-a-playground-of-air-quality-data-124ebd27ec8a#.n3aezb3qd) and [check out](https://medium.com/@openaq/tools-built-by-the-openaq-community-857a82ad9ca9#.w48xyuycd) the awesome tools and software packages our community is building to browse, visualize and use these data.

Shoot us an email at [info@openaq.org](mailto:info@openaq.org) or follow us at [@Open_AQ](https://twitter.com/open_aq) to find out more, give us feedback or  tell us about any cool open air quality work you're up to!

This platform is possible because of air quality agencies around the world, which do the hard task of generating and publicly sharing these data.
