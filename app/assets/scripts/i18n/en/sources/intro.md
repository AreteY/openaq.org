In this first iteration of the platform:

- We aggregate PM2.5, PM10, ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and black carbon (BC).

- Data are from official, stationary government monitors and not smaller-scale or mobile monitors. It is our intent to attribute all data to their originating sources. Please contact us if you notice otherwise.

*Note: We do not guarantee the accuracy of any data aggregated to the platform. Please see originating sites for more information.*

Data aggregated into our system are accessible in a few ways:

- An open API, which allows the user to create customizable queries. Documentation for our API is [here](https://docs.openaq.org/) and step-by-step instructions are [here](https://medium.com/@openaq/accessing-a-playground-of-air-quality-data-124ebd27ec8a). 

- The latest CSV files of air quality data from our platform, sorted by location and attributed to their originating sources, are shared below.

- Daily CSV files of all the data in the system can be found [here](https://openaq-data.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

- Other awesome browsers, visualization tools, and software libraries our community is building [here](https://medium.com/@openaq/tools-built-by-the-openaq-community-857a82ad9ca9#.w48xyuycd).

*Thank-you to the air quality agencies around the world measuring and publicly sharing these data.*
