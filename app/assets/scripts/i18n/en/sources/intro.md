Listed below are the latest data sources and associated datasets with source attribution, accessible on the OpenAQ platform. We recommend obtaining data customized to your need via our open API. Documentation for or API is [here](https://docs.openaq.org/), and step-by-step instructions are [here](https://medium.com/@openaq/accessing-a-playground-of-air-quality-data-124ebd27ec8a).

*With your help*, we expect this list will expand dramatically in the next few months, so check back often. 

In this first iteration of the platform:

- We are only collecting data from official, stationary government monitors and not smaller-scale or mobile monitoring.
- We are collecting PM2.5, PM10, ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and black carbon (BC).

*Note: We cannot verify the accuracy of the data and unless otherwise noted, as these data are collected in real-time, they should be considered preliminary by their sources.*
