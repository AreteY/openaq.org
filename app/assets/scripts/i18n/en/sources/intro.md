In this first iteration of the platform:

- We aggregate PM2.5, PM10, ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and black carbon (BC).

- Data are from official, stationary government monitors and not smaller-scale or mobile monitors. It is our intent to attribute all data in our platform to their originating sources. Please contact us if you notice otherwise.

*Note: We do not guarantee the accuracy of any data aggregated to the platform. Please see originating sites for more information.*

Data aggregated into our system are accessible by an open API, which allows the user to create customizable queries. Documentation for our API is [here](https://docs.openaq.org/) and step-by-step instructions are [here](https://medium.com/@openaq/accessing-a-playground-of-air-quality-data-124ebd27ec8a). 

Additionally, the latest csv files of air quality data from our platform, sorted by location and attributed to their originating sources, are shared below. Lastly, check out the browsers, visualization tools, and software libraries are community is building [here](https://medium.com/@openaq/tools-built-by-the-openaq-community-857a82ad9ca9#.w48xyuycd). 

Thank-you to the air quality agencies around the world measuring and publicly sharing these data.
