Listed below are the latest data sources and associated datasets accessible on the OpenAQ platform. *With your help*, we expect this list will expand dramatically in the next few months, so check back often. 

In this first iteration of the platform:

- We are only collecting data from official, stationary government monitors and not smaller-scale or mobile monitoring.
- We are collecting PM2.5, PM10, ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and black carbon (BC).

The "Resolution" parameter below indicates the time frequency at which the data are archived from a given site, and this corresponds, to the best of our knoweldge, with the frequency at which the data are measured on a given site. 

*Note: We cannot verify the accuracy of the data and unless otherwise noted, as these data are collected in real-time, they should be considered preliminary by their sources.*
