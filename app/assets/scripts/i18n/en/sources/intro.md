In this first iteration of the platform:

- We aggregate data from official, stationary government monitors and not smaller-scale or mobile monitoring. It is our intent to attribute all data in our platform to their originating sources. Please contact us if you notice otherwise.
- We aggregate PM2.5, PM10, ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and black carbon (BC).

*Note: We cannot verify the accuracy of the data and unless otherwise noted, as these data are collected in real-time. Please see originating site for more information for a particular source.*

Data aggregated into our system are accessible by an open API, which allows the user to create customizable queries. Documentation for our API is [here](https://docs.openaq.org/) and step-by-step instructions are [here](https://medium.com/@openaq/accessing-a-playground-of-air-quality-data-124ebd27ec8a). 

Additionally, the latest csv files of air quality data from our platform, sorted by location and attributed to their originating sources, are shared below.

Thank-you to the air quality agencies around the world measuring and publicly sharing these data.
